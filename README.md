# Event-Reminder

This is a simple Event-Reminder with a PHP crud system.
The login credentials are: 
Username: admin
Password: admin

After logging in you will see the home.php, where the entire create, read, update, delete system is located.
You can add a new Reminder for a specific date and when that date comes, there will be a notification in blue colour
on the screen. If you create a Reminder for today, then you will see it immediately of course. 
You can edit the reminder and also delete it. 

The Erinnerung option, is supposed to be the time, when we would like the system to remind us about the upcoming event.
I have never completed such a task however but I did try and research a bit. An easy way but not the actual required one,
would be to receive an email on the day as the event is due. 
However, in order create a script that would do that ahead of time (1day before, 1 week before, etc.) it would require 
a cron job/task which can take quite some time to setup and specially even more for someone like myself, who has never done that 
before. 

Furthermore, there is an Articles page, where I reproduced the same layout as provided in the example. 
I could have gone with a prettier and more creative design, but I thought that part of the task, was to reproduce
the exact same product as close as possible. 

I am looking forward to your feedback and notes.
